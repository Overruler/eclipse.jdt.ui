What's New in This Fork
=======================

This fork contains the JDT UI parts of changes for a few features that I find useful but are missing from the Eclipse IDE. These include:

* Content Assist suggests `ArrayList` as a completion to `List<Object> l = new` as well as other super or subclasses when appropriate.
* Builds nicely as part of eclipse-java8 project for Early Access to Eclipse Java 8.
* Compiles without errors with Java 8 Early Access.
* Compiles without errors with Java 7.
